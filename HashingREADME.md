The Password Manager is a simple console application that helps store and manage passwords securely. It allows users to add, view, and delete password records, but instead of saving the actual passwords, it saves a secure, hashed version using the SHA-256 algorithm. This makes the passwords unreadable, even if someone gets access to the stored data. The application uses a HashMap to organize and access the data quickly. It was created to help people manage their passwords safely and to show how secure password storage works. This tool is easy to use and helps prevent sensitive data from being stolen. It also teaches the importance of using secure coding methods to protect information. The application is useful for anyone looking for a simple way to manage passwords or learn about secure programming. In addition to its functionality, the application raises awareness about the risks of weak or unprotected passwords, making it relevant in todayâ€™s digital age where cybersecurity is essential.
