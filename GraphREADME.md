The Flight Routes Manager is a Java-based console application that simulates a network of cities connected by flight routes using a graph data structure. The application allows users to add cities, establish bidirectional flight routes, display the network's cities and routes, and find the shortest path between two cities using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Designed as both an educational tool and a practical simulation, the program provides a hands-on experience in implementing graph structures and traversal algorithms. It is particularly useful for students and developers to learn graph theory, while educators can use it as a teaching aid or project template. Beyond education, the application demonstrates real-world problem-solving in airline route management, showcasing how cities (nodes) and connections (edges) interact in scalable systems. Its simplicity and versatility make it an excellent open-source resource, with potential for enhancements such as weighted edges, directed routes, and graphical interfaces, contributing to a better understanding of network optimization and data structure applications.
